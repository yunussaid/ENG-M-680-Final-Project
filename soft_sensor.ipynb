        "The 85–15 split represents true forward-in-time generalization, so the models score in a reasonable range (MAPE ~0.19–0.24, R² ~0.60–0.65). This reflects the actual difficulty of predicting silica across different months and operating regimes. When switching to the recommended 1–59 split, performance improves for all models, but LightGBM in particular shows a dramatic jump (MAPE ~0.11, R² ~0.91). This reflects how the task being evaluated is different: under the 1–59 split, the model is not forecasting into the future but interpolating within the same hour, where the target (% Silica Concentrate) is constant for all 60 minutes blocks. Because the test samples come from the same hour as a training sample, the learning problem becomes far easier and variance in the target collapses, inflating R².\n",

The 85–15 results better represent forecasting difficulty, whereas the 1–59 results represent interpolation accuracy. LightGBM’s very strong scores arise from the structure of the data and the easier evaluation setting, not from suspicious behavior.\n"
